The Drown Research Group is a interdisciplinary team of scientists tackling challenging problems facing human health and disease. At the center of our work is a belief in the **_proteoform hypothesis_**: that proteoforms are more tightly linked to phenotype than any other biomolecule and therefore represent the richest source of discovery.

Students in the Drown lab will learn cutting edge chemical biology techniques and be prepared for modern drug discovery. If you are interested in joining the Drown Research Group, [contact Prof. Drown](mailto:{{ site.data.information.email }}).
